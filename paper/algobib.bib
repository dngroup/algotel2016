Some deploy servers in just a few large data centers while others deploy in thousands of locations or even on millions of desktops. Recently, major {CDNs} have formed strategic alliances with large {ISPs} to provide content delivery network solutions. Such alliances show the natural evolution of content delivery today driven by the need to address scalability issues and to take advantage of new technology and business opportunities. In this paper we revisit the design and operating space of {CDN}-{ISP} collaboration in light of recent {ISP} and {CDN} alliances. We identify two key enablers for supporting collaboration and improving content delivery performance: informed end-user to server assignment and in-network server allocation. We report on the design and evaluation of a prototype system, {NetPaaS}, that materializes them. Relying on traces from the largest commercial {CDN} and a large tier-1 {ISP}, we show that {NetPaaS} is able to increase {CDN} capacity on-demand, enable coordination, reduce download time, and achieve multiple traffic engineering goals leading to a win-win situation for both {ISP} and {CDN}.},

	abstract = {Management operations performed by Content Delivery Network ({CDN}) providers consist mainly in controlling the placement of contents at different storage locations and deciding where to serve client requests from. Configuration decisions are usually taken by using only limited information about the carrier networks, and this can adversely affect network usage. In this work we propose an approach by which {ISPs} can have more control over their resources. This involves the deployment of caching points within their network, which can allow them to implement their own content placement strategies. The work presented in this paper investigates lightweight strategies that can be used by the {ISPs} to manage the placement of contents in the various network caching locations according to user demand characteristics. The proposed strategies differ in terms of the volume and nature of the information required to determine the new caching configurations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies, in terms of network resource utilization, based on a wide range of user demand profiles and we compare the obtained performance according to metrics we define to characterize the demand. The results demonstrate that the proposed metrics can provide useful indications regarding the performance one strategy can achieve over another and, as such, can be used by the {ISP} to improve the utilization of network resources.},

However, currently there is not an automatic way to select the security functions to enable and to configure the selected ones according to a set of user's security requirements. This paper presents a first approach towards the integration of network and security policy management into the {NFV} framework. By adding to the {NFV} architecture a new software component, the Policy Manager, we provide {NFV} with an easy and effective way for users to specify their security requirements and a process that hides all the details of the correct deployment and configuration of security functions. To perform its tasks, the Policy Manager uses policy refinement techniques.},

	abstract = {Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking ({SDN}), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. {SDN} introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how {SDN} can improve common network management tasks.},

	abstract = {Streaming video consumption has risen sharply over the last years. It has not only reshaped the Internet traffic, it has also changed the manner of watching videos. Users are progressively moving from the old-fashioned scheduled television to video-on-demand ({VoD}) services. As broadcasting future seems to be online, customers have become more sensitive to {VoD} quality, expecting ever-higher bitrates and lower rebuffering. In this context, average bitrate is a key quality of service ({QoS}) metric. Therefore, content delivery networks ({CDNs}) and content providers must be committed to enforce average bitrate through service-level agreement ({SLA}) contracts. Adaptive content replication is a promising technique towards this goal. However, this still offers a major challenge for {CDN} providers, particularly as they aim to avoid waste of resources. In this work, we introduce {WiseReplica}, an adaptive replication scheme for peer-assisted {VoD} systems that enforces the average bitrate for Internet videos. Using an accurate machine-learned ranking, {WiseReplica} saves storage and bandwidth from the vast majority of non-popular contents for the most watched videos. Simulations using {YouTube} traces suggest that our approach meets users expectations efficiently. Compared to caching, {WiseReplica} reduces the required replication degree for the most-watched videos by two orders of magnitude, and under heavy load, it increases the average bitrate by roughly 85 \%.},

A Telco-{CDN} can be regarded as an intra-domain overlay network with tight resources and critical deployment constraints. This paper addresses two problems in this context: (1) the construction of the overlays used to deliver the video channels from the entrypoints of the Telco-{CDN} to the appropriate edge servers; and (2) the allocation of the required resources to these overlays. Since bandwidth is critical for entrypoints and edge servers, our ultimate goal is to deliver as many video channels as possible while minimizing the total bandwidth consumption. To achieve this goal, we propose two approaches: a two-step optimization where the optimal overlays are firstly computed, then an optimal resource allocation based on these pre-computed overlays is performed; and a joint optimization where both optimization problems are simultaneously solved. We also devise fast heuristic algorithms for each of these approaches. The conducted evaluations of these two approaches and algorithms provide useful insights into the management of critical Telco-{CDN} infrastructures.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing services delivery and consumption model is based on communication infrastructure (network). The network serves as a linkage between the end-users consuming cloud services and the providers of data centers providing the cloud services. In addition, in large-scale cloud data centers, tens of thousands of compute and storage nodes are connected by a data center network to deliver a single-purpose cloud service. To this end, some questions could be raised, such as the following: How do network architectures affect cloud computing? How will network architecture evolve to support better cloud computing and cloud-based service delivery? What is the network's role in reliability, performance, scalability, and security of cloud computing? Should the network be a dumb transport pipe or an intelligent stack that is cloud workload aware? This paper focuses on the networking aspect in cloud computing and shall provide insights to these questions. Researchers can use this paper to accelerate their research on devising mechanisms for the following: (i) provisioning cloud network as a service and (ii) engineering network of data centers.

In this paper we propose to use the Software-Defined Networking ({SDN}) paradigm to decouple data plane and control plane and present {SRSC}, a new routing scheme for {CCN}. Our solution is a clean-slate approach using only {CCN} messages and the {SDN} paradigm. We implemented our solution into the {NS}-3 simulator and perform simulations of our proposal. {SRSC} shows better performances than the flooding scheme used by default in {CCN}: it reduces the number of messages, while still improves {CCN} caching performances.},

	abstract = {The exploding {HD} video streaming traffic calls for deploying content servers deeper inside network operators' infrastructures. Telco-{CDN} are new content distribution services that are managed by Internet Service Providers ({ISP}). Since the network operator controls both the infrastructure and the content delivery overlay, it is in a position to engineer telco-{CDN} so that networking resources are optimally utilized. In this paper, we show the following two findings: 1. it is possible to implement an efficient algorithm for the placement of video chunks into a telco-{CDN}. We present an algorithm, which is based on a genetic algorithm implemented on the {MapReduce} framework. We show that, for a national {VoD} service, computing a quasi-optimal placement is possible. 2. such push strategy makes sense because it allows to actually take into account fine-grain traffic management strategies on the underlying infrastructure. Our proposal re-opens the debate about the relevance of such "push" approach (where the manager of telco-{CDN} proactively pushes video content into servers) versus the traditional caching approach (where the content is pulled to the servers from requests of clients). Our proposal of a quasi-optimal tracker enables fair comparisons between both approaches for most traffic engineering policies. We illustrate the interest of our proposal in the context of a major European Telco-{CDN} with real traces from a popular Video-on-Demand ({VoD}) service. Our experimental results show that, given a perfect algorithm for predicting user preferences, our placement algorithm is able to keep aligned with {LRU} caching in terms of the traditional hit-ratio, but the workload on some troubled links (e.g., over-used links) in a push-based strategy is significantly alleviated.},

	doi = {10.1109/TNSM.2015.2404792},
	abstract = {The collaboration of Internet service providers ({ISPs}) and content distribution network ({CDN}) providers was shown to be beneficial for both parties in a number of recent works. Influencing {CDN} edge server (surrogate) selection allows the {ISP} to manage the rising amount of traffic emanating from {CDNs} to reduce the operational expenditures ({OPEX}) of his infrastructure, e.g., by preventing peered traffic. At the same time, including the {ISP}'s hidden network knowledge in the surrogate selection process influences the quality of service a {CDN} provider can deliver positively. As a large amount of {CDN} traffic is video-on-demand traffic, this paper investigates the topic of {CDN}/{ISP} collaboration from a perspective of high-volume long-living flows. These types of flows are hardly manageable with state-of-the-art Dynamic Name Service ({DNS})-based redirection, as a reassignment of flows during the session is difficult to achieve. Consequently, varying load of surrogates caused by flash crowds and congestion events in the {ISP}'s network are hard to compensate. This paper presents a novel approach promoting {ISP} and {CDN} collaboration based on a minimal deployment of software-defined networking switches in the {ISP}'s network. The approach complements standard {DNS}-based redirection by allowing for a migration of high-volume flows between surrogates in the backend even if the communication has state information, such as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol sessions. In addition to a proof-of-concept, the evaluation identifies factors influencing performance and shows large performance increases when compared to standard {DNS}-based redirection.},

In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive measurement study on Kankan, one of the leading {VoD} streaming service providers in China that is based on a hybrid {CDN}-P2P architecture. Our measurements are multi-fold, as follows. 1) Kankan adopts a loosely-coupled hybrid architecture , in which the user requests are handled by its {CDN} and P2P network independently. 2) Kankan deploys a small-scale {CDN} densely in three geographic clusters in China. It adopts specific redirection servers to dispatch the nationwide requests. 3) Kankan adopts a dual-server mechanism to enhance start-up video streaming. It also provides the {CDN} acceleration in case of inefficient P2P streaming performance. 4) According to our studies on the peer cache lists, the video contents stored in Kankan peers update quite slowly. The average lifetime of cached videos is longer than one week. Our results show that, by utilizing the slow-varying contents cached in peers and deploying various {CDN} enhancement mechanisms , Kankan provides a large-scale {VoD} streaming service with a small-scale fixed infrastructure. Insights obtained in this study will be valuable for the development and deployment of future hybrid {CDN}-P2P {VoD} streaming systems.},

	abstract = {The performance and costs of geo-replicated online services depend on which data centers handle user requests, and which wide-area paths carry traffic. To provide good performance at reasonable cost, service providers adapt the mapping of user requests to data centers (e.g., through {DNS}), and routing of responses back to users (i.e., through multi-homed route control). Mapping and routing are typically managed independently, with mapping having limited visibility into routing decisions, response path latencies, and bandwidth costs. However, poor visibility and uncoordinated decision-making can lead to worse performance and higher costs when compared to a joint decision. In this paper, we argue that mapping and routing should continue to operate modularly, but cooperate towards service-wide performance and cost goals. Our main contribution is a distributed algorithm to steer cooperating, yet functionally separate, mapping and routing provably towards a globally optimal operating point. Trace-based evaluations on an operational {CDN} show that the algorithm converges to within 1\% of optimum in 3-6 iterations.},

This paper explores the possibility to reduce the complexity of such equipment by moving services to some external dedicated and shared facilities. This paper will present first result towards virtualizing home gateway services towards some specific part of the network.

This explosion of data traffic with its dynamically changing traffic patterns and flows might result in degradation of the network performance. In this context, there is a need for an intelligent and efficient network management system that delivers guaranteed services. To this extent, this paper proposes {BaProbSDN}, a probabilistic Quality of Service ({QoS}) routing mechanism for Software Defined Networks ({SDN}). The {QoS} routing algorithm employs the bandwidth availability metric as a {QoS} routing constraint for unicast data delivery. {BaProbSDN} makes use of Bayes' theorem and Bayesian network model to determine the link probability in order to select the route that satisfies the given bandwidth constraint. The performance of the proposed probabilistic {QoS} routing algorithm was tested in a simulation-based environment and compared against the widest-shortest path routing ({WSR}) algorithm. The results demonstrate that {BaProbSDN} can achieve up to 8.02\% decrease in the bandwidth blocking rate when compared to {WSR} in the presence of link update inaccuracies of threshold and time delay.},

	abstract = {To distribute video and audio data in real-time streaming mode, two different technologies - Content Distribution Network ({CDN}) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) - have been proposed. However, both technologies have their own limitations: {CDN} servers are expensive to deploy and maintain, and consequently incur a cost for media providers and/or clients for server capacity reservation. On the other hand, a P2P-based architecture requires sufficient number of seed supplying peers to jumpstart the distribution process. Compared with a {CDN} server, a peer usually offers much lower out-bound streaming rate and hence multiple peers must jointly stream a media data to a requesting peer. Furthermore, it is not clear how to determine how much a peer should contribute back to the system after receiving the media data, in order to sustain the overall media distribution capacity. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel hybrid architecture that integrates both {CDN}- and P2P-based streaming media distribution. The architecture is highly cost-effective: it significantly lowers the cost of {CDN} capacity reservation, without compromising the media quality delivered. In particular, we propose and compare different limited contribution policies for peers that request a media data, so that the streaming capacity of each peer can be exploited on a fair and limited basis. We present: (1) in-depth analysis of the proposed architecture under different contribution policies, and (2) extensive simulation results which validate the analysis. Our analytical and simulation results form a rigorous basis for the planning and dimensioning of the hybrid architecture.},

According to the experimental results, which were obtained for a whole test set of video sequences by using similar encoding configurations for all three examined representative encoders, H.265/{MPEG}-{HEVC} provides significant average bit-rate savings of 43.3\% and 39.3\% relative to {VP}9 and H.264/{MPEG}-{AVC}, respectively. As a particular aspect of the conducted experiments, it turned out that the {VP}9 encoder produces an average bit-rate overhead of 8.4\% at the same objective quality, when compared to an open H.264/{MPEG}-{AVC} encoder implementation - the x264 encoder. On the other hand, the typical encoding times of the {VP}9 encoder are more than 100 times higher than those measured for the x264 encoder. When compared to the full-fledged H.265/{MPEG}-{HEVC} reference software encoder implementation, the {VP}9 encoding times are lower by a factor of 7.35, on average.},

Starting from the core, the impact of these developments is reaching towards the edge of the infrastructure and into the access network. In this spirit, we foresee the opportunity of virtualizing a key device of modern broadband access networks: the Residential Gateway ({RGW}). Presently located on the customer premises, the {RGW} stands between the home network and the access network. It imposes a considerable cost for the operator (acquisition and operation) and constitutes a single point of failure for all the services offered to the residential customers - such as Internet access, {VoIP}, {IPTV} and Video-on-Demand. In this paper we propose an architecture for virtualized Residential Gateways ({vRGWs}) which physically removes the {RGW} from the customer premises, moving it into the operator data center as a virtualized entity. This solution potentially reduces deployment, maintenance and operation costs, whilst improving overall flexibility, reliability and manageability - both for the access network infrastructure and for provided services.},

In this paper, we adopt a measurement-based approach to understanding why, how, and how much {CP}-level intelligences can help content delivery. We first present a measurement study of the {CDN} built by Tencent, a largest content provider based in China. We observe new characteristics and trends in content delivery which pose great challenges to the conventional content delivery paradigm and motivate the proposal of {CPCDN}, a {CDN} powered by {CP}-aware information. We then reveal the benefits obtained by exploiting two indispensable {CP}-level intelligences, namely context intelligence and user intelligence, in content delivery. Inspired by the insights learnt from the measurement studies, we systematically explore the design space of {CPCDN} and present the novel architecture and algorithms to address the new content delivery challenges that have arisen. Our results not only demonstrate the potential of {CPCDN} in pushing content delivery performance to the next level, but also identify new research problems calling for further investigation.},

Using as a basis one of the network functions offered by network routers, this article presents the analysis, design, and the first implementation, in a virtualized manner, of the routing function. Considering the current co-existence of {IPv}4 and {IPv}6 and the possibilities brought into the arena by {OpenFlow}-enabled infrastructures, the article describes the design of the virtualized routing protocol, enabling a simple management and avoiding signaling messages overhead in the control plane level, and the different scenarios considered to validate the virtualized function. In essence, the manuscript describes one of the first implementations of the functional {NFV} concept, through the virtualization of the routing function over an {OpenFlow} network. The different scenarios validated in the article are used to demonstrate the applicability of the {NFV}-powered implementation proposed into actual production environments.},

	abstract = {The popularity of multimedia services offered over the Internet have increased tremendously during the last decade. The technologies that are used to deliver these services are evolving at a rapidly increasing pace. However, new technologies often demand updating the dedicated hardware (e.g., transcoders) that is required to deliver the services. Currently, these updates require installing the physical building blocks at different locations across the network. These manual interventions are time-consuming and extend the Time to Market of new and improved services, reducing their monetary benefits. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, Network Function Virtualization ({NFV}) was introduced by decoupling the network functions from the physical hardware and by leveraging {IT} virtualization technology to allow running Virtual Network Functions ({VNFs}) on commodity hardware at datacenters across the network. In this paper, we investigate how existing service chains can be mapped onto {NFV}-based Service Function Chains ({SFCs}). Furthermore, the different alternative {SFCs} are explored and their impact on network and datacenter resources (e.g., bandwidth, storage) are quantified. We propose to use these findings to cost-optimally distribute datacenters across an Internet Service Provider ({ISP}) network.},

Considering these analysis results, it is believed that modularization and Japanese manufacturers' offshore production have led to global competition and production volume has increased due to active investment on {LCD} industry, which resulted in price competition and commoditization.

Content distribution systems that assign servers at the application level can respond very rapidly to changes in the routing of the network. Consequently, the traffic engineer's decisions may not be applied to the intended traffic. We use a game-theoretic framework in which infinitesimal users of a network select the source of content, and the traffic engineer decides how the traffic will route through the network. We formulate a game and prove the existence of equilibria. Additionally, we present a setting in which equilibria are socially optimal, essentially unique, and stable. Conditions under which efficiency loss may be bounded are presented, and the results are extended to the cases of general overlay networks and multiple autonomous systems.},

	abstract = {Recently, the Internet has become a popular platform for the delivery of multimedia content. However, its best effort delivery approach is ill-suited to guarantee the stringent Quality of Service ({QoS}) requirements of many existing multimedia services, which results in a significant reduction of the Quality of Experience. This paper presents a solution to these problems, in the form of a framework for dynamically setting up federations between the stakeholders involved in the content delivery chain. More specifically, the framework provides an automated mechanism to set up end-to-end delivery paths from the content provider to the access Internet Service Providers ({ISPs}), which act as its direct customers and represent a group of end-users. Driven by Service Level Agreements ({SLAs}), {QoS} contracts are automatically negotiated between the content provider, the access {ISPs}, and the intermediary network domains along the delivery paths. These contracts capture the delivered {QoS} and resource reservation costs, which are subsequently used in the price negotiations between content provider and access {ISPs}. Additionally, it supports the inclusion of cloud providers within the federations, supporting on-the-fly allocation of computational and storage resources. This allows the automatic deployment and configuration of proxy caches along the delivery paths, which potentially reduce delivery costs and increase delivered quality.},

We demonstrate three such modules. {MicroCDN} is a dynamic content distribution network ({CDN}) service which implements a content caching strategy specific to a content provider. The {NAT} Keep-alive module offloads the processing of keep-alive messages from {SIP} servers. The Media Relay module allows any {NetServ} node to act as a media relay, eliminating the need to manage standalone relay servers. {NetServ} aims to revive the Active Networking vision.

By simplifying and harmonizing the use of {IaaS} cloud infrastructures using lightweight virtualization approaches, the transfer of cloud deployments between a variety of cloud service providers becomes more frictionless. This article proposes operating system virtualization as an appropriate and already existing abstraction layer on top of public and private {IaaS} infrastructures, and derives an reference architecture for lightweight virtualization clusters.

	abstract = {Emerging information-centric networking architectures drives a wider focus of content caching mechanisms. Most recent efforts have been attempting for server and user friendliness, i.e., reduction in content-server load and content-delivery time. Those solutions require the prior knowledge of cache state and content popularity exchanged among routers. Challenging tasks are pushed to routers since their explicit coordination is required. Instead of burdening routers, but still keeping the effectiveness of in-network caching, we move the explicit coordination task from routers to a cache orchestrator where the offline optimal caching policy is computed while leaving the simplest cache decision to the routers. By means of the network function virtualization, this paper proposes a cache orchestration lifecycle including three parts, i.e., name hit caching ({NHC}) policy, pending time history and network cache orchestration. By exploiting {NHC} policy, a router simply caches the content whose name matches its assigned content name set. Evaluation through simulations demonstrates that {NHC} policy achieves the lowest content-server load and content downloading time and the highest cache hit ratios in all routers comparing with leaving copy everywhere, probability caching and content-popularity-based cache orchestration policies.},

By shifting most of the service execution environment - e.g. the Web browser - to a Cloud infrastructure, the {vSTB} concept addresses certain limitations of current {IPTV} deployments. Nevertheless, routing {UI} delivery out of the Cloud causes a significant impact on the network infrastructure, which might have some implications for {IPTV} system response and can therefore result in a lower Quality of Experience overall. This paper describes this approach and its current implementation, as well as identifying and addressing network challenges that emerged in a corresponding project in the Telekom Innovation Laboratories. Furthermore, this paper provides a comparison between {IPTV} service executed locally on an end-user device (locally-rendered {IPTV} {UI}), and that delivered to an end-user after it was executed within the cloud (Cloud-rendered {IPTV} {UI}) and empirically shows the feasibility of the presented {vSTB} Approach.},

Because a traffic engineer may be unaware of the structure of content distribution systems or overlay networks, this management of the network does not fully anticipate how traffic might change as a result of his actions. Content distribution systems that assign servers at the application level can respond very rapidly to changes in the routing of the network. Consequently, the traffic engineer's decisions may almost never be applied to the intended traffic. We use a game-theoretic framework in which infinitesimal users of a network select the source of content, and the traffic engineer decides how the traffic will route through the network. We formulate a game and prove the existence of equilibria. Additionally, we present a setting in which equilibria are socially optimal, essentially unique, and stable. Conditions under which efficiency loss may be bounded are presented, and the results are extended to the cases of general overlay networks and multiple autonomous systems.},

	abstract = {The performance and costs of geo-replicated online services depend on which data centers handle user requests, and which wide-area paths carry traffic. To provide good performance at reasonable cost, service providers adapt the mapping of user requests to data centers (e.g., through {DNS}), and routing of responses back to users (i.e., through multi-homed route control). Mapping and routing are typically managed independently, with mapping having limited visibility into routing decisions, response path latencies, and bandwidth costs. However, poor visibility and uncoordinated decision-making can lead to worse performance and higher costs when compared to a joint decision. In this paper, we argue that mapping and routing should continue to operate modularly, but cooperate towards service-wide performance and cost goals. Our main contribution is a distributed algorithm to steer cooperating, yet functionally separate, mapping and routing provably towards a globally optimal operating point. Trace-based evaluations on an operational {CDN} show that the algorithm converges to within 1\% of optimum in 3-6 iterations.},

As network connectivity is increasingly a commodity, {ISPs} have a strong incentive to offer content to their subscribers by deploying their own content distribution infrastructure. Providing content services in an {ISP} network presents new opportunities for coordination between traffic engineering (to select efficient routes for the traffic) and server selection (to match servers with subscribers). In this work, we develop a mathematical framework that considers three models with an increasing amount of cooperation between the {ISP} and the {CP}. We show that separating server selection and traffic engineering leads to sub-optimal equilibria, even when the {CP} is given accurate and timely information about the {ISP}'s network in a partial cooperation. More surprisingly, extra visibility may result in a less efficient outcome and such performance degradation can be unbounded. Leveraging ideas from cooperative game theory, we propose an architecture based on the concept of Nash bargaining solution. Simulations on realistic backbone topologies are performed to quantify the performance differences among the three models. Our results apply both when a network provider attempts to provide content, and when separate {ISP} and {CP} entities wish to cooperate. This study is a step toward a systematic understanding of the interactions between those who provide and operate networks and those who generate and distribute content.},

	doi = {10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838322},
	abstract = {Over the years, the demand for high bandwidth services, such as live and on-demand video streaming, steadily increased. The adequate provisioning of such services is challenging and requires complex network management mechanisms to be implemented by Internet service providers ({ISPs}). In current broadband network architectures, the traffic of subscribers is tunneled through a single aggregation point, independent of the different service types it belongs to. While having a single aggregation point eases the management of subscribers for the {ISP}, it implies huge bandwidth requirements for the aggregation point and potentially high end-to-end latency for subscribers. An alternative would be a distributed subscriber management, adding more complexity to the management itself. In this paper, a new traffic management architecture is proposed that uses the concept of Software Defined Networking ({SDN}) to extend the existing Ethernet-based broadband network architecture, enabling a more efficient traffic management for an {ISP}. By using {SDN}-enabled home gateways, the {ISP} can configure traffic flows more dynamically, optimizing throughput in the network, especially for bandwidth-intensive services. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept implementation of the approach is presented to show the general feasibility and study configuration tradeoffs. Analytic considerations and testbed measurements show that the approach scales well with an increasing number of subscriber sessions.},

Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queuing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router configurable is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex configurations easier to write, including pull connections, which model packet flow drivn by transmitting hardware devices, and flow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements. Click configurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click {IP} router has 16 elements on its forwarding path; some of its elements are also useful in Ethernet switches and {IP} tunnelling configurations. Extending the {IP} router to support dropping policies, fairness among flows, or Differentiated Services simply requires adding a couple of element at the right place. On conventional {PC} hardware, the Click {IP} router achieves a maximum loss-free forwarding rate of 333,000 64-byte packets per second, demonstrating that Click's modular and flexible architecture is compatible with good performance.},

	abstract = {The computational world is becoming very large and complex. Cloud Computing has emerged as a popular computing model to support processing large volumetric data using clusters of commodity computers. According to J.Dean and S. Ghemawat [1], Google currently processes over 20 terabytes of raw Web data. It's some fascinating, large-scale processing of data that makes your head spin and appreciate the years of distributed computing fine-tuning applied to today's large problems. The evolution of cloud computing can handle such massive data as per on demand service. Nowadays the computational world is opting for pay-for-use models and Hype and discussion aside, there remains no concrete definition of cloud computing. In this paper, we first develop a comprehensive taxonomy for describing cloud computing architecture. Then we use this taxonomy to survey several existing cloud computing services developed by various projects world-wide such as Google, force.com, Amazon. We use the taxonomy and survey results not only to identify similarities and differences of the architectural approaches of cloud computing, but also to identify areas requiring further research.},
