\begin{abstract}
La consommation de videos "over the top" a changé la donne pour les acteurs du monde de la livraison de contenu. La chaine de valeur a glissé progressivement en faveur des fournisseurs de contenus et des réseaux de livraison de contenu et au détriment des fournisseurs d'accès.
Notre contribution propose un nouveau modèle de collaboration entre ces différents acteurs par la création d'une plateforme où sont déployées des chaînes de service de distribution de contenu. Nous étudions en particuliers les solutions de placement de ces fonctions réseaux sur un substrat de serveur virtualisés au sein d'un réseau respectant l'approche Software Defined Network (SDN) dans lequel sont déployées des infrastructures de virtualisation de fonction réseau (NFV).

\section{Introduction}
Real-time entertainment (video and audio streaming) is the number one service on the current Internet: it accounts for 68.90\% of the Downstream Peak Period Traffic in North America in Q2 2015  \cite{sandvine_2015}. As the Internet was not originally designed for streaming high quality video, delivering this massive amount of content is a challenging task. 

One solution to mitigate those issues is to use Content Delivery Networks (CDN). 
CDNs have been created to improve network performance for end-users while at the same time limiting the need for Content Providers (CP) to own an infrastructure \cite{pathan2014cloud}.
By deploying servers in strategic locations, CDN Providers assign users to a close-by server, thus reducing hop count and avoiding congestion occurrences.

In this very competitive market, the majority of ISPs are being kicked out of the video delivery value chain and is struggling to minimize the drop in their revenues \cite{wulf_carrier_2010}.  
However, even if their business role in the delivery part is challenged by CDNs, ISPs still hold a valuable asset: they can manage the whole network, i.e., the complete routing process end-to-end. 

The envisioned solution is a collaboration model for ISP and CDN around a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture.
We propose a solution where ISPs can manage a NFV infrastructure where CDNs can run their caching software as NFVs through a virtual CDN (vCDN) network function.
It is a win-win approach since CDNs can expand their coverage dynamically without buying new servers and ISPs can increase their revenue by billing them while reducing inter-AS traffic.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:architecture} describes the architecture of the solution, while Section~\ref{sec:model} details the model used to optimize the placement of the whole content delivery service. Section~\ref{sec:result} presents the results of the modelization. We conclude the paper in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{A NFV/SDN platform for virtual CDN deployment in the ISP's network\label{sec:architecture}}

CDN and ISP do not naturally collaborate.
They have their own specific problems to solve resulting in conflicting outcomes \cite{jiang_cooperative_2009}.
In order to overcome the CDN-ISP collaboration challenges, we propose a Virtualized Infrastructure solution capable of matching ISP's connectivity "supply" with the CDN's connectivity "demand", towards a win-win approach.

\subsection{High-Level Architecture}

Our proposal, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:overlay}, aims at instantiating a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) platform within the ISP Network capable of hosting, among others, Virtual CDN (vCDN) services. 

This platform is distributed amongst several NFV infrastructure points of presence (NFVI-POP), at the edge of the network. 
NFVI-POPs are datacenters that provide compute resources (CPU, RAM, HDD) to run virtual Network Functions (vNF) on, following an Network Function as a Service (NFaaS) approach.

On top of the compute part, virtual routes are defined between end-users and vCDN instances. 
This solution masks the underlying network to the CDNs and keep the ISP topology and features secret, following a private Connectivity as a service (CaaS) approach.

By combining and orchestrating both network and compute resources together, the ISPs can resell them to third parties.
Following this concept, ISPs are capable of proposing Service Level Agreement (SLA) to the CDNs for them to run their vCDNs Network functions.	
For example, a CDN can contract with an ISP to organize the delivery of 5.000 concurrent streaming sessions in the Bayonne metropolitan area, with HD resolution.

\subsection{Implementing the Content Delivery Service}

While an SLA is a good way for CDNs to formulate their business needs, it doesn't specify technically how ISPs should implement it on their network.
In this section, we present the translation of the SLA into a Content Delivery Service Chain.

\subsubsection*{The canonical model}
The canonical representation of Content Delivery Service is depicted Figure~\ref{fig:canonical}, where two distinct flows emerge from the source $s$. 
On one hand, we have the $s\rightarrow CDN$ flow which represents the traditional path to content delivery: packets flow through the ISP autonomous system (AS) and reach the seperate CDN AS.
On the other hand, the $s \rightarrow vCDN$ flow is targetted at an NFVI-POP within the ISP AS.
It is the enhanced distribution path on which the CDN want to apply the SLA. It has tighter network constraints (low delay, high bandwidth) and can hence deliver better quality videos.

\subsubsection*{Leveraging Virtual Home Gateways}
Traditionnal DNS redirection methods can be used by CDNs to decide to which server steering traffic. 
As they have a full control of the network, Operators can benefit from an SDN approach to control traffic with more flexibility.

To deploy configuration to network devices, the SDN approach relies on "southbond technologies"  which can be limited in feature.
Openflow \cite{mckeown2008openflow} is SDN's most used southbound protocol.
To this day, it only handles logic rules on levels 1 to 4 of the OSI layer model.
This limits the possibilities left by the CDNs to choose the righ server.
In fact, relying on the domain name to chose


To mitigate this issue, Virtual Home Gateways can be used to enhance content distribution \cite{etsi001}. 
vHG are virtual appliances that outsource traditional physial Home Gateway's Network Functions to the cloud, leaving a simple L2 bridge on the user premicises \cite{herbaut2015migrating}. 
In our usecase, vHG can be seen as a transit function able to flag outgoing flows according to L5-L7 rules, like HTTP URL for instance.
vHG can seggregate traffic targetted to vCDN from the one targetted to CDN allowing packets to follow distinct routes with distinct network caracteristics.

The resulting service can now be seen as a Service Chain depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:vhg}.
The ISPs need to embed the service chain generated from the CDN SLA into their substrate network. 
This problem is known as Service Chain Embedding \cite{service chain} where we need to map a service graph $G^{S}=(N^{S},E^{S})$ to a substrate graph $G=(N,E)$ representing the real ISP network. Figure~\ref{fig:service-mapping} shows such a mapping.

SLAs varies in the amont of physical resources needed and can be very demanding sometimes. In this context, it can be quite challenging for the ISPs to map a vNF to a single POP or a Route the resulting traffic though a single route with guaranteed delay.
To ease embedding into the network, ISP can transform the canonical service into an other form by splitting vNF and routes as shown Figure~\ref{fig:vhg-lb}. 
As nothing prevent vNFs to be allocated on the same POP, nor routes to be mapped to the same set of edges, the probability of  successful embeding for transformed model is at least equal to the canonical model.
Having traffic and resource split, however can be easier to allocate on the substrate network.
